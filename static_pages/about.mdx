Hello, I am Jovan Bienvenu. Front-end Developer/React Developer from France who loves code and design. I use React.js or Next.js to build interfaces and features for web applications. At the moment, I'm in my last year of study in computer science

My interest in computers started at a very young age, and I was very eager to learn as much as possible about them. I remember my first website, created years ago, with a terrible interface and design. It was designed to showcase my cousin, a world champion French boxer.

From there, I started learning about web development through numerous video tutorials, documentations and articles. The first programming language I learned was C#. Since then, I have also learned Javascript. I also played with databases, SQL and NoSQL.

Besides coding, I also write articles about web development on my blog. I like sports, I'm a big fan of combat sports, especially French boxing which I've been practicing for more than 20 years and of which I'm French champion.

If you ask me which stack I prefer, I would say

Framework : Reactjs / Next.js
Database : MongoDB
CSS : MaterialUI / TailwindCSS

You can do anything you can think of with these three things. Next.js is an open-source web development framework built on top of Node.js enabling React-based web application features such as server-side rendering and static website generation.

I love my work. Feel free to have a look at my portfolio and don't hesitate to contact me.
