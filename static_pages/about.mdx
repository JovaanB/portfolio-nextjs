Hello, I am Jovan Bienvenu. A Front-end Developer/React Developer from France who loves code and design. I use React.js or Next.js to build interfaces and features for web applications. At the moment, I'm pursuing my degree in computer science.

My interest in computers started at a very young age, and I was very eager to learn as much as possible about them. I remember my first website I created years ago, which had a terrible interface and design. It was designed to showcase my cousin, a world champion French boxer.

From there, I started to learn about web development through many video tutorials, documentations and articles. The first programming language I learned was C#. Since then, I have also learned Javascript. I also played with databases, SQL and NoSQL.

Besides coding, I also write articles about web development on my blog. I love sports, I'm a big fan of fighting sports, especially French boxing which I've been practicing for more than 20 years and of which I'm a French champion

If you ask me which stack I prefer, I would say

- Framework : Reactjs / Next.js
- Database : MongoDB
- CSS - MaterialUI / TailwindCSS

You can do anything you can think of with these three things. Next.js is an open-source web development framework built on top of Node.js enabling React-based web application features such as server-side rendering and static website generation.

I love my work and enjoy each project as I get it. Feel free to look at my portfolio and don't hesitate to contact me.
